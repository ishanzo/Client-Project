  Check if the input is a number and if yes, tell user to start again.
  Exit the program in terminal to let user start all over again.

Define a function that checks to see if the rank input variable is correct.
  Check if the input is a number, if not, tell user to start again.

  Define a function that checks to see if the gender input variable is correct.
    Check if the input is a gender, if not, tell user to start again.
    Exit the program in terminal to let user start all over again.

Repeat 10 times but with different variables for each guest.
Input question on guest's name as a variable.
Check if user's input is correct using function created above.
Input question on guest's gender as a variable.
Check if user's input is correct using function created above.
Input question on guest's rank as a variable.

Define a function that converts rank to seating position.
  If rank is 0, the guest is the host/ess.
  If rank is 1, the guest's index position will be 1.
  If rank is 2, the guest's index position will be 10.
  If rank is 3, the guest's index position will be 6.
  If rank is 4, the guest's index position will be 5.
  If rank is 5, the guest's index position will be 2.
  If rank is 6, the guest's index position will be 9.
  If rank is 7, the guest's index position will be 7.
  If rank is 8, the guest's index position will be 4.
  If rank is 9, the guest's index position will be 3.
  If rank is 10, the guest's index position will be 8.

Call the function created above 10 times which parameters that correspond to each of the three questions asked to ten guests.
